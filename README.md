# public-message-board
Coding Challenge - A Public Message Board

This is a sample Java / Spring Boot application that has CRUD operations for a public message board.

## How to run

After cloning this repo, you can build and run it with your favourite IDE on your local machine.

Another option is to use docker image. You can build and run the project on Docker using Dockerfile existing in the project.

To build and run, you may find the commands below:

````
docker build -t gruske/public-message-board .

docker run -p 8080:8080 gruske/public-message-board
````

Or if you want, you can access/download the docker image via the link below, so you won't need to build it.
 
``https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/gruske/public-message-board``

Once the application runs you should see something like this...

```
INFO 16124 --- [           main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http) with context path ''
INFO 16124 --- [           main] c.g.p.PublicMessageBoardApplication      : Started PublicMessageBoardApplication in 8.683 seconds (JVM running for 9.693)
```

Now you can access the application with the url ``http://localhost:8080/``

Those are the username&password pairs that are added to the application. One of them must be used as a Basic Authentication to make a successful request. 
* Admin - admin
* Han - solo
* Padme - amidala
* Anakin - skywalker

You can find a screenshot how to enter this information in Postman.
